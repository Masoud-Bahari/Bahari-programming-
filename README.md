# Bahari Programming

## Overview
Welcome to my repository! This project showcases my skills in **C++, Visual Basic for Application (VBA),  MATLAB, Mathematica, and Python**, 
demonstrating my ability to solve **complex problems in data analysis, mathematical modeling, and 
algorithm development**. Each programming language has been selected for its unique strengths in addressing specific tasks.

## Codes
### VBA
This folder contains VBA codes that assist authors in creating a unique job application letter. The codes include functions for translating the letter into German and English, creating root folders, and saving and exporting the letter. Additionally, it allows for the modification of predefined RichText variables inside the document and other related tasks. Once the code is executed, it displays a form that collects data from the user and performs predefined tasks in a Microsoft Word document. The main codes are stored in file "TheMainForm.frm"

### MATLAB
This repository includes three MATLAB scripts developed to calculate the energy of 3D unconventional superconductors. 
I primarily used MATLAB for numerical computations where analytical approaches are insufficient. 
After running the code, you will generate plots similar to the attached "Output1_numerics1.png" and "Output1_numerics1.fig".

1. **Matlab_PhD_numerics_1**: This script computes the excitation spectrum of a multiband superconductor in the 2D Brillouin zone. The energy gap at low energies is induced by the superconducting order parameter. In this calculation, we consider a finite-size geometry with 100 layers.

2. **Matlab_PhD_numerics_2**: This script analyzes the isotropy of finite-energy Cooper pairing. The output represents circular nodes as a function of momentum.

3. **Matlab_PhD_numerics_3**: This script computes the Bogoliubov de Gennes spectra in a 3D Brillouin zone.

### Mathematica
I have utilized Mathematica for its powerful capabilities in analytical calculations. This section includes two files:

1. **Mathematica_PhD_computation_1**: This file contains analytical calculations to investigate the spectral properties of multiband superconductors.

2. **Mathematica_PhD_computation_2**: This file includes fitting and numerical analyses relevant to my PhD project.

### C++
I initially learned programming with C++. Here are two examples I developed that demonstrate a random walk on triangular and hexagonal lattices.

### Python
This section contains a script for email automation. The Python code is capable of sending bulk emails automatically and saves the recipient information, date, time, and body text into a spreadsheet.

## Conclusion
Thank you for visiting my repository! I welcome any feedback or questions regarding the codes or their applications. Please feel free to reach out via my contact information below.
